# HabitOrbit
Visual habit tracker that displays 21-day streaks as orbit plots using Python, Pands, and Matplotlib.

#Features
- Reads data from a simple CSV (date + habits as Y/N or 1/0).
- Calculates daily completion ratios.
- Plots a 21-day “orbit” showing streak strength and gaps.
- Supports both **overall completion orbit** and **per-habit orbits**.

# Tech Used
python
Pandas (Data analysis)
NumPy (numerical ops)
Matplotlib (orbit plots)
Google Colab

#Why I built this
This started as something of a personal project for myself. Seeing the visualization helped me stay consisten and motivated.
I can see streaks, gaps, and momentum across the 21 days.

#Future ideas
Would love to turn this into an app.
